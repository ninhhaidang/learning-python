# Exercise 10: Combined Operations

## 🎯 Objective

Integrate all Week 1 concepts into comprehensive programs that solve real-world problems using variables, data types, operators, input/output, and formatting.

## 📋 Problem Description

Create a multi-function program that demonstrates mastery of all Python fundamentals learned in Week 1 by building practical applications.

## 📥 Input Requirements

The program should handle various inputs for different modules:

- Personal information (name, age, etc.)
- Financial data (income, expenses)
- Academic data (scores, subjects)
- Measurement data (dimensions, quantities)

## 📤 Expected Output

```
=== Python Fundamentals Integration ===

Choose a program to run:
1. Personal Information Manager
2. Budget Calculator
3. Grade Analyzer
4. Geometry Calculator
5. Unit Converter
6. Exit

Enter your choice (1-6): 2

=== BUDGET CALCULATOR ===
Enter your monthly income: $5000
Enter your expenses:
  Rent: $1200
  Food: $400
  Transportation: $300
  Entertainment: $200
  Other: $150

┌─────────────────────────────┐
│       BUDGET SUMMARY        │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ Monthly Income: $5,000.00   │
│ Total Expenses: $2,250.00   │
│ Remaining: $2,750.00        │
│ Savings Rate: 55.0%         │
│ Status: ✅ Healthy Budget   │
└─────────────────────────────┘
