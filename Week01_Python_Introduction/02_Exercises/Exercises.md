## 💡 How to Use Each Exercise

### For Each Exercise Folder:

1. **Read `problem.md`** - Understand the requirements
2. **Open `practice.py`** - Start coding in the practice file
3. **Check `guide.md`** - If you need hints or guidance
4. **Compare with `solution.py`** - After completing your attempt

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Start with problem.md** - Always read the requirements first
2. **Try before looking** - Attempt the exercise before checking guides
3. **Test your code** - Run and verify your solutions
4. **Use comments** - Explain your thinking process
5. **Learn from solutions** - Compare your approach with provided solutions

## 🆘 Getting Help

- Check the theory files in `01_Theory/` for reference
- Review the solution files only after attempting the exercise
- Use Python documentation and help() function
- Ask questions in class or during office hours

## 📈 Assessment
